### Tech

- [[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)]

- [[lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash)]
- [[ajv](https://ajv.js.org/)]

## Steps to run the utility

Log Validation Tool requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

1. Clone the repository, navigate to log-validation-utility and install the dependencies.

```sh

cd log-validation-utility

npm i
```

2. Move all the API payloads inside "/public/logs" folder or mention the path to the logs folder as demonstrated in the next step.

3. Run the utility in the following format

   > node index.js "domain" "/path/to/logs/folder/"

```sh
node index.js retail ./public/logs/
```

In case of IGM domain will be igm.

4. A text report (log_report.md) will be generated upon successful execution of the utility.
<!-- 5. An error handling txt file (error_report.txt) will also be generated to catch all the errors occurred during the execution. -->

_Notes:_

> There must be a separate payload for every API.

> All the payloads should be named in the correct format as mentioned in the table below.

> The utility validates all the 18 payloads as documented in the [API Contract](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z0eT1PZ8_tthEyxli8bLs-B9oCYAZIS0/view).
