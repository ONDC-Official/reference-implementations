# Subscribing to ONDC Registry

1. Add following constants like below.

```
- PRIVATE_KEY_1 = "NP's encryption private key"
- PUBLIC_KEY_1 = "Registry's encryption public key"
- REQUEST_ID = "request_id which is sent in /subscribe"
- SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY = "NP's signing private key"
```

2. Place the index.js file code into your main file, and this utility will host the on_subscribe endpoint as well as html file.
